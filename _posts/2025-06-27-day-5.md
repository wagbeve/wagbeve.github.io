  **IT Team**:  
  The morning began with an in-depth session with **Mike Bush**, who gave me one of the most insightful conversations of the week.  
  We discussed everything from the Rockies’ IT infrastructure to broader topics like cybersecurity and even how AI is being integrated into security practices.  
  Mike emphasized how the IT team balances system security with accessibility, especially on game days.  

  After our discussion, he took me on a tour of designated ballpark areas where critical servers and networking equipment are located.  
  Seeing the infrastructure that supports mobile connectivity, Wi-Fi, and fan-facing technologies highlighted just how crucial IT is to smooth operations.  

  **Finance Team**:  
  I then joined a Q&A session with **Douglas Mylowe** (Vice President – CFO), **Gary Lawrence** (Senior Director – Procurement), and **Phil Emerson** (Senior Director – Accounting).  
  While we talked about budgeting and financial operations, what stood out most was their career advice — they spoke about networking, mentorship, and building long-term professional growth in sports organizations.  

  **Human Resources & Ballpark Tour**:  
  Over lunch, **Krystina Rocha** and **Charlene Hartt** gave me another tour of Coors Field, showing areas I hadn’t yet seen, including merchandise shops.  
  We talked casually about Denver life, career development, and how each part of the ballpark ties into creating a great fan experience.  

  **Leadership & DiSC Assessment**:  
  In the afternoon, I met with **Dallas Davis** for my **DiSC assessment**.  
  We went through my results together and discussed how different communication styles impact team collaboration.  
  Dallas also gave me advice on how to leverage my strengths in future leadership roles.  

  **Baseball Analytics Team**:  
  Later in the day, I joined **Brian Jones** and the baseball analytics team.  
  Brian explained how player performance data, scouting reports, and predictive models inform game strategy and roster decisions.  

  He introduced me to his team, and I visited different desks to ask questions about their projects — from biomechanics to situational performance analysis.  
  The conversations gave me a real sense of how collaborative and fast-paced the analytics environment is.  

  **Final Recap & Reflection**:  
  To close the week, I met again with **Krystina Rocha** for a final recap.  
  We reflected on everything I had learned, and I shared how much this experience broadened my perspective on sports operations.
