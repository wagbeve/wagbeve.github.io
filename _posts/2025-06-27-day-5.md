  **IT Team**:  
  The morning began with an in-depth session with **Mike Bush**, who gave me one of the most insightful conversations of the entire week. We talked about everything from the Rockies’ IT infrastructure to broader topics like cybersecurity and even how AI is being integrated into modern security practices. Mike emphasized the delicate balance between keeping systems secure and ensuring accessibility for multiple departments, especially during high-attendance events.  

  After our discussion, Mike took me on a tour of designated areas around the ballpark where critical servers and networking equipment are housed. Seeing the physical infrastructure that supports mobile connectivity, Wi-Fi, and other fan-facing technologies really drove home how essential IT is to the entire operation.  

  **Finance Team**:  
  Later in the morning, I joined a **Q&A session with Douglas Mylowe** (Vice President – Chief Financial Officer), **Gary Lawrence** (Senior Director – Procurement), and **Phil Emerson** (Senior Director – Accounting). What stood out about this session was how it went far beyond just numbers. While we talked about budgeting, revenue streams, and financial oversight for both the team and the stadium, they also shared career insights, stressing the importance of professional development, networking, and mentorship in sports organizations. Hearing their personal stories made the session feel not just educational but inspiring.  

  **Human Resources & Ballpark Tour**:  
  During lunch, **Krystina Rocha** and **Charlene Hartt** took me on another tour of Coors Field, showing me areas I hadn’t explored yet, including the merchandise shops and other fan-facing operations. It was fascinating to see how these areas contribute to the overall fan experience, and Krystina explained how each part of the ballpark ties into larger operational strategies. The casual nature of the lunch also gave us time to talk about career development and reflect on the week.  

  **Leadership & DiSC Assessment**:  
  After lunch, I met with **Dallas Davis** for my **DiSC assessment**. We went through my results together, discussing how understanding different personality and communication styles can help in team collaboration and leadership roles. Dallas offered advice on how to leverage my strengths and continue developing areas that would make me more effective in diverse work environments.  

  **Baseball Analytics Team**:  
  In the afternoon, I joined the **Baseball Data team** led by **Brian Jones**. Brian walked me through the day-to-day operations of his team, explaining how player performance data, scouting information, and advanced analytics all feed into game strategy and roster decisions.  

  After our discussion, he introduced me to the rest of the team, and I spent time visiting individual desks to learn about the specific projects each member was working on. From player biomechanics to situational performance predictions, every project highlighted just how much data drives modern baseball. I asked plenty of questions, and each conversation gave me a clearer picture of how collaborative and innovative the analytics team is.  

  **Final Recap & Reflection**:  
  To close out the week, I met again with **Krystina Rocha** for a final recap and reflection. We talked about everything I had learned over the five days, from technical skills to professional growth. Sharing my experiences and hearing her feedback felt like the perfect way to wrap up my time with the Rockies — it was a moment to step back, reflect, and appreciate just how much I had gained in such a short time.
