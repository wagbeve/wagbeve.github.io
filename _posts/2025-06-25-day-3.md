departments_interacted_with:
  "Season Ticket Sales Team": |
    The morning started with a deep dive into season ticket data alongside **Ryan Wetterich** and **Sara Bergerson**. Unlike previous observations, I had the chance to work directly on a project, using **Python** to analyze datasets for different seasonal ticket categories. Running through the numbers, I could see how patterns in attendance and purchasing behavior informed how the team builds relationships with long-term fans.  

    Ryan and Sara explained how much of their work is about trust — fans who invest in season tickets aren’t just buying seats, they’re buying into an experience. Understanding their preferences and keeping them engaged is as much about listening as it is about analyzing data, and this perspective shaped how I looked at the project.

  "Human Resources": |
    Around midday, I joined the **HR Team** for an outing to the **Lookout Mountain Preserve and Nature Center**. It was a refreshing change of pace, and it gave me a chance to see a different side of the team outside of meetings and office work. We walked trails, talked about career paths, and shared stories over lunch while enjoying the view of Denver from the mountain.  

    More than anything, it felt like being welcomed into a family. The conversations weren’t forced or overly formal — just genuine interactions that made me feel like I was truly part of the Rockies organization, not just an observer.

  "Communications & PR Team": |
    The afternoon and evening were spent shadowing **Shelby Cravens** and the Communications & PR team. This time, I watched much of the action unfold from the **Press Club**, giving me a front-row view of how game-day operations are coordinated behind the scenes.  

    Shelby talked me through the pace of her work — preparing pregame updates, handling in-game communication, and being ready to respond quickly to anything unexpected. Watching from the Press Club gave me a clear sense of how every announcement, press update, and fan-facing message is carefully timed and executed.  

    The experience changed how I look at game-day operations — I could finally connect all the moving parts I had been learning about to the live energy of a Rockies game.

what_i_learned: |
  Today reinforced how data, relationships, and communication all come together in sports operations. Working directly with Python to analyze season ticket data helped me understand how raw numbers translate into real decisions that affect fan engagement.  

  The HR outing reminded me that building relationships inside an organization is just as important as building them with fans. And shadowing Shelby gave me a firsthand look at how crucial precision and adaptability are in game-day communications.

what_stood_out: |
  The view from Lookout Mountain and the conversations with the HR team stood out because it made me feel like I was becoming part of the Rockies family, not just an intern passing through.  
  Watching the Communications team operate from the Press Club was equally eye-opening — seeing how quickly Shelby and her team adapted to real-time changes showed me the level of professionalism required to keep everything running smoothly during a live event.

work_done: |
  Used Python to analyze season ticket datasets, identifying patterns in attendance and purchase behaviors.  
  Participated in professional development discussions with the HR team during an outing at Lookout Mountain Preserve and Nature Center.  
  Shadowed Shelby Cravens from pregame through postgame activities, observing PR and communications workflows from the Press Club.

questions_raised:
  - How are fan engagement strategies adjusted based on real-time observations during games?  
  - What role does PR play in shaping the fan experience beyond game-day communications?  
  - Are there opportunities to integrate predictive analytics into season ticket sales strategies?

feedback_suggestions: |
  The day brought together different sides of the organization in a way that felt connected and meaningful. Working on a real project, bonding with the HR team, and watching the game-day operations unfold from the Press Club all added layers to my understanding of how much collaboration and care go into making every fan’s experience memorable.
