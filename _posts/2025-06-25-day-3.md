  **Season Ticket Sales Team**:    
  The morning started with the **Season Ticket Sales Team**, where I worked closely with **Ryan Wetterich** and **Sara Bergerson**. They welcomed me into their space and treated me like part of the team from the start.  

  I had the chance to work on a project analyzing season ticket data, and for the first time, I used Python to dig into real Rockies datasets. Running scripts to identify attendance patterns and trends felt exciting — every line of code translated into understanding the habits of actual fans. Ryan shared how these insights help guide conversations with season ticket holders, while Sara explained how the data directly supports relationship-building strategies.  

  **Human Resources**:  
  Around midday, I joined the HR team for lunch and a professional development activity at the **Lookout Mountain Preserve and Nature Center**. It was a refreshing change of pace from the office. We explored the scenic trails, talked about career growth, and even shared stories about life in Denver.  

  The casual setting made it easy to connect with the team, and for the first time, I really felt like part of the Rockies family. It wasn’t just a work outing — it felt like a genuine effort to build relationships and make me feel valued.  

  **Communications & PR Team**:  
  The evening was spent shadowing **Shelby Cravens** and the Communications and PR team during game-day operations. From the **Press Club**, I got a front-row seat to how much coordination goes into running a live game. Shelby walked me through the pregame preparations, media interactions, and in-game updates, explaining how timing and messaging are everything.  

  Watching the team work in real time gave me a new appreciation for how much goes on behind the scenes to keep fans informed and engaged. Every tweet, every press interaction, and every announcement was carefully planned — it was incredible to see that level of precision up close.  

what_i_learned: |
  Today gave me a deeper appreciation for how different departments work together to create a great fan experience.  
  Working with Ryan and Sara showed me how season ticket data is used to build strong, long-term relationships with fans, and how Python can help uncover valuable trends.  

  The HR lunch was a reminder that professional development goes beyond just technical skills — building relationships and feeling part of the culture is equally important.  
  The PR and Communications experience highlighted how essential clear messaging and coordination are during high-pressure game moments.  

what_stood_out: |
  What stood out the most was the contrast between the quiet, analytical morning and the fast-paced, high-energy evening.  
  Running Python scripts on fan data in the morning felt worlds apart from watching Shelby and her team coordinate live updates from the Press Club, but both were equally important to the fan experience.  

  The Lookout Mountain Preserve trip also stood out as a personal highlight — it was a chance to slow down, explore Denver’s beauty, and feel like part of a close-knit community within the Rockies organization.
