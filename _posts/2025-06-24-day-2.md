  Today reinforced the critical importance of clean, accurate data in managing ticketing systems.  
  I gained hands-on experience in identifying and correcting data anomalies such as bad codes, and how survey data integrates into overall system analytics.  
  I also learned about the workflows and tools the team uses to maintain high-quality ticketing data for reporting and decision-making.

  The meticulous attention to detail required to maintain ticketing data integrity was eye-opening.  
  The collaborative efforts between Becky and Brenna in troubleshooting and analyzing data highlighted how teamwork accelerates problem-solving.  
  The recap session with Dallas offered great insight into how cross-department communication supports smooth operations.

  Engaged actively in data cleanup tasks focused on identifying bad codes and validating survey data.  
  Participated in detailed data analysis to uncover trends and inconsistencies in ticketing information.  
  Contributed to documentation and shared findings with the team to improve data quality practices.

questions_raised: |
  - How are bad codes typically generated or introduced in the ticketing system?  
  - What tools or platforms do Becky and Brenna prefer for data validation and error tracking?  
  - How does the team prioritize and escalate data issues that affect ticket sales or customer experience?

feedback_suggestions: |
  The detailed walkthroughs and hands-on activities were very helpful.  
  It might be useful to have a quick reference guide or checklist for common data issues encountered in the ticketing system to aid interns during cleanup tasks.  
  Also, more opportunities for interns to review and interpret survey data trends would deepen understanding.
