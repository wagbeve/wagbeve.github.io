  Ticketing Technology: |
    The day was spent with the **Ticketing Technology Team**, working closely with **Brenna Nelson**. She gave me a detailed look at how survey data feeds into decision-making across the organization, explaining how each response — from fan satisfaction to entry experiences — is carefully reviewed and organized.  

    Brenna walked me through her workflow, showing how she uses Excel to sort, filter, and interpret information in ways that help the team identify trends. Watching her work made me realize how much effort goes into ensuring that data stays reliable enough to guide real decisions.  

    Toward the late afternoon, I met with **Dallas Davis** for a recap session, where we reflected on what I had observed and talked briefly about the plan for the next day.

what_i_learned: |
  Today gave me a better understanding of just how critical accurate data is to the fan experience. Survey responses aren’t just collected and stored — they’re actively used to spot patterns, improve services, and anticipate issues before they happen.  

  Brenna showed me how to approach survey data methodically, focusing on consistency and careful validation to make sure nothing is overlooked. I also learned how important it is to think about the fan’s perspective while looking at numbers; every row in a spreadsheet represents a real experience inside the ballpark.

what_stood_out: |
  What stood out most was the patience and precision Brenna brought to her work. She explained why even small formatting errors or mislabeling could throw off a report, which really highlighted how much attention to detail this role demands.  

  The evening was a completely different experience — I attended my first live baseball game as the Rockies played the Dodgers. The energy in the ballpark was electric, and for the first time, I was able to connect what I had learned during the day to what I was seeing around me. Watching fans enjoy the game, moving smoothly through gates, and finding their seats easily made me appreciate how behind-the-scenes work like ticketing technology directly shapes these moments.

work_done: |
  I observed Brenna as she reviewed and organized survey data, asking questions as she explained her reasoning for different steps. She showed me how she uses Excel functions like pivot tables to organize responses and track emerging trends.  

  Although I didn’t directly manipulate the data myself, following along with her process gave me valuable insight into how the team maintains the quality and accuracy of its reports.  

  The evening game added a new perspective — seeing thousands of fans entering the ballpark and enjoying themselves felt like a real-world extension of the data work, showing how operations, technology, and fan experience are all connected.

questions_raised:
  - How frequently are survey insights shared with other departments, such as PR or operations?  
  - Are there specific trends the team monitors most closely during high-attendance games like Rockies vs. Dodgers?

feedback_suggestions: |
  The day felt very well-structured, and Brenna took the time to explain not just what she was doing but why it mattered. Seeing a game later the same day made everything feel much more connected — it was a great way to understand how the work we discussed directly supports the fan experience.
