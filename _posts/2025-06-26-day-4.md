  **Season Ticket Sales Team**:  
  The morning started with a deeper dive into the world of season ticket sales. I reconnected with **Ryan Wetterich** and **Sara Bergerson**, who took me on a tour of the various Club Suites at Coors Field — exclusive spaces dedicated to season ticket holders.  

  As we walked through the suites, Ryan explained how these premium areas are tied to relationship-building and long-term retention. Sara talked through the data points they monitor — from suite usage to engagement rates — and how the team uses this information to refine their strategies and keep fans returning each season.

  **Ticketing Technology Team**:  
  I then spent time with **Becky Arrieta** and **Brenna Nelson** working on a new internal project centered around fan behavior inside the **MLB Ballpark app**. My task was to analyze customer impressions and behavior patterns, focusing on how fans navigate features, redeem tickets, and interact with services.  

  Using Python, I combed through app usage data to identify recurring behaviors and possible areas for improvement. Brenna helped clarify what certain variables meant in context, while Becky explained how the tech team translates findings into updates for both the app and physical entry systems.

  Over lunch with the ticket tech team, I was also introduced to **Power Ticket Testing** — a system used to test and verify ticket scanning devices in real-time scenarios. It was a chance to not only learn the theory, but also observe how it functions during live operations.

  **Game Observation**:  
  Later in the day, I stayed on-site for the Rockies game, this time with a sharper lens. Having worked with both the sales and tech teams throughout the day, watching fans flow through the gates and interact with staff felt more meaningful. I began noticing how much of the behind-the-scenes work I’d seen all week directly translated into the smooth, seamless experience fans were having at the ballpark.

what_i_learned: |
  Today helped solidify my understanding of how different departments — sales, tech, and operations — converge around one goal: improving the fan experience.  

  Through the Ballpark app data project, I saw how Python can be used to uncover insights that drive user interface decisions and ticket redemption features. Touring the suites with Ryan and Sara also gave me a better appreciation for the thought and strategy behind premium seating.  

  Finally, seeing the game live reminded me that every line of code or data point is ultimately about creating a great day for someone in the stands.

what_stood_out: |
  The Ballpark app analysis was a highlight — not only did I get to work with live data, but I could see how every insight might influence future app updates.  

  The Power Ticket testing also stood out as one of the most hands-on sessions so far. Sitting with the tech team and watching them test hardware in real-time gave me a front-row view into how much goes into getting fans through the gates efficiently.  

  Touring the suites earlier in the day also made a big impression — they weren’t just luxury boxes; they were key pieces in the Rockies’ long-term relationship strategy.

work_done: |
  - Analyzed fan behavior data from the MLB Ballpark app using Python.  
  - Explored Club Suites with Ryan and Sara to understand how data supports customer retention strategies.  
  - Observed Power Ticket testing and had lunch with the ticketing technology team to better understand the operational side of real-time scanning systems.  
  - Attended the evening game to observe and reflect on the full cycle of fan engagement and entry systems in action.

questions_raised: |
  - How often are app usage insights reviewed or used to inform design decisions?  
  - What does the troubleshooting process look like when Power Ticket systems fail on game day?  
  - How are suite-level analytics shared with other departments like marketing or guest services?

feedback_suggestions: |
  Today felt like a perfect blend of technical analysis and field observation. The hands-on experience with app data and ticket scanning systems made everything feel real and connected.  

  The mix of guided tours, project work, and live game exposure offered a well-rounded view of how the Rockies balance innovation, hospitality, and precision.
