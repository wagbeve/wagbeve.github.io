  **Season Ticket Sales Team**:  
  The morning started with a deeper dive into the world of season ticket sales. I reconnected with **Ryan Wetterich** and **Sara Bergerson**, who took me on a tour of the various Club Suites at Coors Field — exclusive spaces dedicated to season ticket holders.  

  As we walked through the suites, Ryan explained how these premium areas are tied to relationship-building and long-term retention. Sara talked through the data points they monitor — from suite usage to engagement rates — and how the team uses this information to refine their strategies and keep fans returning each season.

  **Ticketing Technology Team**:  
  I then spent time with **Becky Arrieta** and **Brenna Nelson** working on a project analyzing fan behavior inside the **MLB Ballpark app**. My task was to evaluate customer impressions and behavior patterns, focusing on how fans navigate features, redeem tickets, and interact with services.  

  Using Python, I combed through app usage data to identify recurring behaviors and possible areas for improvement. Brenna helped clarify what certain variables meant in context, while Becky explained how the tech team translates findings into updates for both the app and in-venue services.  

  Over lunch, I joined the ticket tech team for **Power Ticket Testing** — a feature that allows fans to use their PowerTickets at Coors Field to purchase concessions and merchandise seamlessly. Watching the team run test transactions to ensure everything worked properly was a fascinating look into how technology is used to enhance convenience for fans on game day.  

  At the end of the day, I presented my analysis of the Ballpark app data to **Brenna Nelson**, walking her through my findings and highlighting patterns I had identified. Sharing insights and discussing how they might be applied to improve fan interactions made the project feel meaningful and connected to the Rockies’ broader goals.

  **Game Observation**:  
  Later in the day, I stayed on-site for the Rockies game, this time with a sharper lens. Having worked with both the sales and tech teams throughout the day, watching fans move around the concourse, buying food, and enjoying the game felt different. I could see how the work being done behind the scenes — from suite data to app updates to Power Ticket functionality — was directly shaping the fan experience.

what_i_learned: |
  Today helped solidify my understanding of how data and technology translate into real fan experiences.  

  The Ballpark app analysis showed me how fan behavior is monitored and improved over time, while the Power Ticket testing gave me insight into how convenience features are rolled out and maintained. Presenting my findings to Brenna also gave me a sense of ownership and reinforced how even small data insights can help drive improvements.  

  Touring the suites with Ryan and Sara gave me a better appreciation for the strategic work that goes into retaining premium customers. Seeing a game after working through all this made everything feel connected — the technology, the sales strategy, and the actual excitement in the stands.

  Presenting my project to Brenna was definitely a highlight — being able to share insights and discuss their potential impact felt rewarding.  

  The Power Ticket testing stood out as well, showing how much attention to detail goes into making purchases easy for fans. The Ballpark app analysis was exciting because it had real implications, and seeing fans interact with these systems during the game tied everything together.  

  Touring the Club Suites also left an impression, giving me a better sense of how much relationship-building is tied to physical spaces at the ballpark.
