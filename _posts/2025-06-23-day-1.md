  The first day was a fantastic introduction to the Colorado Rockies organization. I got to meet the HR team, tour Coors Field, and dive into ticketing data analysis.

  From stepping into Coors Field to collaborating on real data cleanup tasks, this day was full of learning and excitement. The culture here combines tradition and innovation, making baseball more than just a game.
