departments_interacted_with: |
  - **Human Resources Team**: Met with Dallas Davis who led the welcome, provided badges, and introduced us to the company culture.  
  - **Ticketing Technology Team**: Worked with Becky Arrieta and Brenna Nelson on data cleanup and analysis related to season ticketing systems.  
  - **Organizational Leadership**: Attended an overview session with Dallas Davis about how the Rockies’ departments coordinate to deliver a great fan experience.

what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned that behind every game is a complex operation that relies heavily on both people and technology.  
  From HR onboarding to detailed data management, each department plays a critical role.  
  The ticketing data cleanup session showed me the importance of clean, accurate data in supporting decisions and operations in sports organizations.

what_stood_out: |
  What really stood out was the seamless integration of tradition and modern technology at the Rockies.  
  Walking through Coors Field gave me a sense of history and atmosphere, while the tech sessions revealed a forward-thinking approach to fan engagement and operational efficiency.  
  The genuine collaboration between departments surprised me — everyone was very approachable and clearly passionate about their roles.

work_done: |
  I participated in setting up my work environment with the HR team, including badge and computer setup.  
  I toured the ballpark to get familiar with the venue and the environment where the work happens.  
  Later, I actively contributed to cleaning and analyzing ticketing data, learning the tools and workflows used by the tech team.

questions_raised: |
  - What specific software tools and data platforms do the Rockies use for ticketing analytics?  
  - How does the HR team support ongoing intern development beyond the onboarding day?  
  - What metrics or KPIs does the team track to measure success in ticket sales and fan engagement?

feedback_suggestions: |
  The first day was very well-organized and welcoming. It would be helpful to include a brief technical overview of the main systems interns will work with, perhaps through a quick demo or walkthrough.  
  Also, providing a small FAQ document about daily schedules and common questions could help future interns prepare better.
