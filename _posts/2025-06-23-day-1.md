departments_interacted_with: |
  - **Human Resources Team**:  
    Spent the morning with members of the HR team, including **Dallas Davis**, **Kimberly Molina**, and **Charlene Hartt**. The conversation gave me a clear picture of how HR supports every part of the Rockies organization — from recruiting and employee development to benefits and day-to-day staff needs. Dallas also helped me get settled in on my first day, making sure I had my badge for building access and the computer I’ll be using throughout my time here.  

  - **Ticketing Technology Team**:  
    Worked with **Becky Arrieta** in the afternoon, where she walked me through how ticketing data is managed. She demonstrated how Excel — especially pivot tables — is used to track and clean large amounts of ticketing information, flagging bad or duplicate codes. Becky also took me on a tour to all of the entry gates in the ballpark to explain how ticket scanning works in real time and how the data they clean and handle feeds directly into those systems.  

  - **Organizational Overview**:  
    Had a session with Dallas Davis, where we looked into Organizational structure. Dallas explained how different departments — HR, Ticket Sales, Operations, Services & Marketing, Baseball Operations, Finance & Legal, and Ballpark Operations — coordinate and communicate to make sure everything runs smoothly.

what_i_learned: |
  Today gave me a clear sense of how much coordination goes into running an organization like the Rockies.  
  - HR is more than just onboarding — it plays a big role in keeping employees engaged and making sure each department has the resources they need.  
  - Accurate ticketing data isn’t just about numbers; it impacts how smoothly fans enter the ballpark and how sales trends are monitored.  
  - Even though sports are fast-paced, reliable systems like Excel are still a backbone for operations when used correctly.

what_stood_out: |
  - How welcoming everyone was — the HR team was open about their work and made the first day feel comfortable.  
  - Walking through the ballpark during the tour was a great way to connect what we see on the field with all the behind-the-scenes work it takes to make it happen.  
  - Seeing how closely technology and operations are tied together, even with tools as familiar as Excel.

work_done: |
  - Met with the HR team to understand their roles and how they collaborate with other departments.  
  - Got settled with the essentials — badge and computer for my time here.  
  - Toured Coors Field, walking through key areas of the ballpark to get a sense of game-day operations.  
  - Observed ticketing data cleanup and learned how errors are identified and corrected.

questions_raised: |
  - How frequently are ticketing reports updated during the season?  
  - Which metrics are considered most important for tracking fan attendance trends?

feedback_suggestions: |
  Day 1 was a solid introduction to the Rockies’ operations. The mix of HR discussions, organizational insights, and ticketing technology observations provided a strong foundation for understanding how everything works together behind the scenes.
