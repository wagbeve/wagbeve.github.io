  - **Human Resources Team**:  
    Sat in with members of the HR department, including Dallas Davis, Kimberly Molina, and Charlene Hartt, for an overview of HR operations and how different teams support both seasonal and full-time staff. Topics touched on included onboarding processes, employee benefits, and general staff development initiatives.

  - **Ticketing Technology Team**:  
    Spent time with Becky Arrieta and Brenna Nelson learning about ticketing systems and data management. We went over how ticket data is processed, the importance of maintaining clean records, and how issues like incorrect or duplicate codes are handled.

  - **Organizational Coordination**:  
    Briefly discussed how different departments—HR, Ticketing, and other operational units—work together to ensure smooth game-day experiences and accurate data reporting.
