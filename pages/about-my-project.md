project:
  title: "SmartServe"
  problem: |
    Millions of pounds of near-expiry food are thrown away daily while people in low-income communities go hungry.

  approach: |
    We are building a **digital marketplace** to redistribute near-expiry food from manufacturers, retailers, and restaurants to consumers.  
    This marketplace connects businesses with surplus food to people who need it most, reducing food waste and helping communities.

  outcome: |
    Our goal is to reduce food waste by **30%** in pilot cities while improving access to affordable food.
