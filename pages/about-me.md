    Baseball — who would’ve thought?

    I came into my internship week with the **Colorado Rockies** barely knowing the difference between a fastball and a foul. My only exposure to the game had been through YouTube clips: flashy highlights, walk-off homers, crowd noise echoing through a screen. I thought I’d seen it. I hadn’t.

    Nothing prepared me for the moment I stepped into **Coors Field.**

    The sun lit the stadium in gold. The air buzzed with anticipation. The crack of the bat was sharper, louder — real. Every cheer felt like a wave crashing through thousands of people at once. For the first time, I wasn’t just watching a game. I was part of it.

    But the real magic happened behind the scenes.

    In rooms filled with whiteboards, charts, and quiet intensity, I watched how a sport so rooted in tradition could be so driven by data, timing, and collaboration. I saw how scouts, coaches, and analysts wove instincts and insights into every decision. It wasn’t just baseball — it was a living system of strategy, trust, and constant adaptation.

    I learned that even when you don’t know the rules at first, you can still find your place in the game — if you listen, ask, observe, and show up ready to grow.

    Now that the week is over, I’ve downloaded the MLB Ballpark app. Not just to track scores, but to stay connected to something I didn’t expect to love. Because baseball, like most things in life, is deeper when you see what happens off the field — and I’m not done learning.
